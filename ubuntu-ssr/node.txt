Since I won't upload large files on github, the Ubuntu version of ssr is not in this project for you. You can find the Ubuntu version of the client by searching for "electron-ssr" in github.

Such as: https://github.com/qingshuisiyuan/electron-ssr-backup


On Ubuntu systems, you also need to set these up:
System Settings -> Network -> Network proxy -> Method
		Method-->>Automatic
		Configuration URL -->> http://127.0.0.1:2333/proxy.pac
	Then -> Apply system wide

System Settings -> Network -> Network proxy -> Method
		method -> Manual
		HTTP Proxy -->> 127.0.0.1      12333
		HTTPS Proxy -->> 127.0.0.1      12333
		FTP Proxy -->> 
		Socks Host -->> 127.0.0.1      1080
	Then -> Apply system wide
